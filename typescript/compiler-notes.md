# Compiler Notes

## Notes

<https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/overview/binder>

> While the above architecture is true as a simplified understanding of TypeScript js generation, a key feature of TypeScript is its Semantic system. In order to assist type checking (performed by the checker), the binder (in binder.ts) is used to connect the various parts of the source code into a coherent type system that can then be used by the checker. The main responsibility of the binder is to create Symbols.

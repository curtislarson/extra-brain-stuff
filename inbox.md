- have a strongly typed function call to initialize the service, connect to service, etc.
- have one function that takes an unknown value, runs it through the validation function, then calls the typed function
- the context stuff seems to be brittle / annoying.
- I guess I do actually need some sort of di container or maybe a base class?

- Can we combine cacache with esbuild?

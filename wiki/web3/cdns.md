# Cdns

## Notes

cdns like skypack, jspm, etc are imo the future

## Ideas

Using a provider setup like what [jspm does](https://github.com/jspm/generator#defaultprovider) along with the functionality in the jpm tools and deno we could attempt to generically import any dependency from any of these locations.

We would have to judge what is best based on a bunch of heuristics / ai stoofs

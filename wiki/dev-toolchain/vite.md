# Vite

## Notes

- Enjoyed it so far, seems to work really well for F.E code.
- Didn't take much effort to port over a react javascript project

- Has proxy support for preview environments using [node http proxy](https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy#options)
- Needs to have brotli support
- We can run it as a node server also?

# Literal Mapper

## Notes

Data mapper ex ssm

- Something that maps a key / path / uri / namespace string or brand to a json value
- Mapper must have schema associated with response, data, error cases
- Optionally has selector to pluck a sub section of data
- Optionally has a predicate that decides whether to return the value or null

Should all be standardized request response types

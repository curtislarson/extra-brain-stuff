# Tooling

## Notes

- Lots of different tools each with their own config file
- Newer ones writte in go or rust usually. Probably worth learning `go` at some point.

List of popular tools (mostly what i use)

### `git`

the best

### `esbuild`

super fast, no config, can use build script

### `tsc`

`tsconfig.json` - I only try to use it for typechecking these days

### `deno`

Enjoyed playing around with their dev tooling. I think some serious projects could come out of it

### npm

`package.json`

- has a crazy amount of functionality in the cli that I still keep discovering new things with

### lsif

- Language server index format

### parcel

have not tried yet, they have clean code but use flow

### snowpack

have not tried yet, i like their cdn [skypack.dev](https://skypack.dev) though

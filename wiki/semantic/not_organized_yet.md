conjunction

- In natural language, the denotation of expressions such as English "and".
- In programming languages, the short-circuit and control structure.
- In set theory, intersection.
- In lattice theory, logical conjunction (greatest lower bound).
- In predicate logic, universal quantification.
  .

disjunction (inclusive or exclusive or)

- in natural language, the denotation of expressions such as English "or".
- tagged union

subject column, the predicate column, and the object column
RDF uses subject instead of object (or entity) in contrast to the typical approach of an entity–attribute–value model in object-oriented design: entity (sky), attribute (color), and value (blue).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL
SPARQL allows for a query to consist of triple patterns, conjunctions, disjunctions, and optional patterns.[8]

Future of JS Thoughts:

- Short URL Base64 used to encode data
- Import url from base64
- Offload data needs onto wikidata or some equivalent
- Offload config to github/s3
- Can be run on
- Be able to run full ingestion pipelines

Markdown Web Thought:

- You can execute code in markdown! https://github.com/google/zx/blob/main/docs/markdown.md
- Link to github documentation with https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources
- Link to code: https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-a-permanent-link-to-a-code-snippet
- https://github.com/retextjs/retext-keywords

AST Thoughts:

- JSONSchema + JSON LD -> ES AST
- ES AST -> Unified AST
  - Unified gives us remark, retext, rehype, etc with the markdown ecosystem
  - We can do text extraction
- We can patch AST

Other Thoughts:

- Can we use json ld to provide a more specific context to a DAG graph?

# SSM

## Notes

- Easily store credentials, shouldn't cost anything

- Can search via path

- Most people recommend using [jq](../cli/links.md#jq) to parse responses

- Can use labels with ssm for better querying

- Also have tags but unfortunately you can't get them directly via the api

`aws ssm describe-parameters` can list all the params

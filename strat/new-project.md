# Automated Scripts we need for a new project

- As soon as we setup repo we should ingest everything about the previous repo as a baseline

- Scan for anything that stands out

- Assuming we are on github, setup a basic action and test it immediately to ensure there's no integration problems.
- _highly_ consider setting up your local environment to accomodate for this
- We do need a better central scraping lcation
